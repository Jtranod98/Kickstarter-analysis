# Kickstarter-analysis
Analysis on Kickstarter data with excel

## Overview of Project: 
  Using Excel formulas and graphs to create and analyze outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

### Purpose: 
  To see which amount of funding goal and which launch date have the most successful campaign; 
  and which amount and which date have the most failures.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
  The number of successful campaigns was highest in the month of May and the lowest was in December.  
  The number of failed campaigns was highest in the month of October and the lowest was in November.  
  Note that December has almost equal outcomes for both successful campaigns and failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  Goals with less than 1000 have the highest successful outcomes. But, the second high Successful group is in goals between 35000 to 45000.
  Goals with 45000 and above have the highest failed outcomes. The second high failed group is in goals between 25000 to 29999.
  Note that no plays were canceled regardless of goal amount.
  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  One of my challenges was using the  Pivot table. I had difficulty deciding which value to place in the row and column fields.  To overcome it I just randomly put different values in the boxes and see the changes.


## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. The month of May is the most successful time to launch a campaign.
  2. In The month of December the outcome is about 50/50 to be successful or fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  one of the limitations in this dataset is the currencies.  Since they are not in the same denomination it can't be used as a value for comparison between countries.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    Some other possible tables and graphs are Outcomes based on country, backers_count, or Staff_pick.

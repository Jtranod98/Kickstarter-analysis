# Kickstarter-analysis
Analysis on Kickstarter data with excel

## Overview of Project 
  Using Excel Pivot tables, formulas and graphs to create and analyze campaign outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

### Purpose 
  To compare the outcomes of different campaigns based on funding goals and launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
  The month of May has the highest number of successful campaigns then taper off.  The month of October has the highest number of failed campaigns.  Note that in December the number of both successful campaigns and failed campaigns are almost equal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  Goals with less than $1,000 have the highest successful outcomes and least failure.
  Goals with $45,000 and above have the highest failed outcomes.
  One interesting note, goals between $35,000 to $45,000 have more successful outcomes than failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  One of the challenges I encountered was using the Pivot table. I had difficulty deciding which value to use in the row and column fields. To overcome this I randomly put different values in the boxes and see the changes.

## Results
- Two conclusions I draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are:
  1. The month of May is the most successful time to launch a theater campaign.
  2. The month of October has the highest number of failed campaigns.  So, to have a best chance of success a theater campaign should be launching in May.

- One conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals is that small goals, less than $1000, have better chance for success than large goals.
  
- Some limitations of this dataset are:
  1. This dataset is too general regarding to the originated country it is not specific to regions, city, or state within a country.
  2. This dataset compares parent category of theater only, the outcomes may be different if we had used different category.
  
- Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are Outcomes based on country, Outcomes based on backers_count, or Outcomes based on Staff_pick.
